This flowchart provides a strategic framework for deciding when to build AI agents versus using simpler workflows. 

Four critical decision points guide your assessment:
First, complexity evaluation - tasks with multiple steps, conditional logic, or specialized knowledge favor agents. Simpler, linear tasks work better as workflows.

Second, value assessment - tasks worth more than $1 per execution justify agent development costs. For tasks valued under $0.10, standard workflows offer better ROI.

Third, feasibility check - all components of your task must be technically achievable for agents to succeed. If any critical parts aren't doable, scope reduction becomes necessary before proceeding.

Finally, risk analysis - low-consequence errors make agents suitable. When errors could be costly or difficult to detect, implement read-only modes or human-in-the-loop systems as safeguards.

This decision framework balances technical requirements, business value, implementation feasibility, and risk tolerance. Use it to objectively evaluate automation opportunities and allocate resources appropriately between developing sophisticated agents and implementing simpler workflow solutions.

While building AI Agents, a storage layer (database) is essential and that is where I recommend using SingleStore.
