# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Core Components

### Vector Search
RAG systems rely heavily on vector search capabilities to find relevant information. This involves:

- **Vector Stores**: Specialized databases optimized for storing and searching vector embeddings
  - Popular options include FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, and others
  - These stores enable efficient similarity search across large document collections

- **Embedding Models**: Convert text into vector representations
  - Various providers offer embedding models (OpenAI, Cohere, BAAI)
  - These models capture semantic meaning in a way that allows for similarity comparison

### RAG Retriever
The retriever component is crucial for finding relevant information:

- **Dense Retrieval**: Uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar content
- **Sparse Retrieval**: Traditional keyword-based search methods
- Often, hybrid approaches combining both methods yield the best results

## Advanced RAG Techniques

### Reranking
Reranking improves the quality of retrieved results by reordering them based on relevance scores.

### Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HYDE)
HYDE is an innovative approach that generates hypothetical answers before retrieval to improve search accuracy.

### Agentic RAG
Agentic RAG extends traditional RAG by incorporating autonomous decision-making capabilities:

### Multi-hop and Context-aware Retrieval
- **Multi-hop Retrieval**: Chains multiple retrieval steps to gather information from different sources
- **Context-aware Retrieval**: Considers the conversation context when retrieving relevant information
- These approaches help build more comprehensive and accurate responses

## Best Practices
1. Use appropriate chunking strategies for your documents
2. Implement proper reranking mechanisms
3. Consider hybrid retrieval approaches
4. Monitor and evaluate retrieval quality
5. Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
