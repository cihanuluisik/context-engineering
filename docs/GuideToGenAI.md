# Comprehensive Guide to Generative AI

**Estimated time needed:** 15 minutes

## Introduction

Generative AI (GenAI) has evolved from basic text and image generation to powering complex systems such as AI agents, enterprise automation, and reasoning engines. This guide explores core concepts, tools, and frameworks for building modern GenAI applications, including RAG, multi-agent systems, prompt engineering, and cutting-edge libraries like LangGraph.

Whether you're developing chatbots, automation workflows, or knowledge systems, this guide provides a roadmap to the latest advancements. It also introduces additional terms not covered in the course videos. These terms are essential for enhancing your understanding of the course concepts.

## Core GenAI Concepts & Terminologies

| **Chain-of-Thought** | Encouraging step-by-step reasoning. | "First, calculate X. Then, compare it to Y. Final answer: ___" |
| **Prompt Chaining** | Breaking complex tasks into smaller prompts executed sequentially. | Prompt 1: Extract keywords → Prompt 2: Generate summary from keywords. |

## Key Architectures & Workflows

### RAG Pipeline

1. **Retrieval**: Query vector database (for example, Pinecone) for context.
2. **Augmentation**: Combine context with user prompt.
3. **Generation**: LLM (for example, GPT-4) produces final output.

### Multi-Agent System

- **Agents**: Specialized roles (for example, researcher, writer, critic).
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph for cyclic workflows, AutoGen for conversations, and so on.
- **Tools**: Web search, code execution, API integrations, and so on.
