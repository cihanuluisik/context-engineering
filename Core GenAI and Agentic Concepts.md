## 1. Foundational Concepts
- Thinking of AI as your thought partner
- Must-know generative AI terms:
  - Tokens, embeddings, context window
  - Temperature, top-k, top-p sampling
  - Hallucination, grounding
- Prompt Engineering:
  - Few-shot, zero-shot, one-shot
  - Prompt chaining and compression
- Transformation Architecture:
  - Attention mechanism
  - Transformer blocks
  - Positional encoding
- LLMs:
  - Model families (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, LLaMA)
  - Open vs. closed models
  - Scaling laws

## 2. Model Training and Adaptation
- Training:
  - Pretraining vs. supervised fine-tuning
  - Self-supervised learning
- Fine-tuning:
  - LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT
- Continual learning
- Distillation and quantization

## 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector Search:
  - Vector stores (FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, etc.)
  - Embedding models (OpenAI, Cohere, BAAI, etc.)
- RAG Retriever:
  - Dense vs. sparse retrieval
- Advanced RAG Usages:
  - Ranking, reranking
  - HYDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)
  - Agentic RAG
  - Multi-hop and context-aware retrieval

## 4. LLM Model Interactions
- Function/Tool Calls (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
- MCP (Multi-Call Prompting)
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)

## 5. Agentic AI
- Workflow orchestration:
  - LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen
- Agent design:
  - Planner, executor, critic roles
  - Memory and planning
  - Multi-agent collaboration

## 6. Reasoning and Tool Use
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
- Reflexion
- PaS / PaE (Plan-and-Solve / Plan-and-Execute)
- Tree of Thought (ToT)
- Chain of Thought (CoT)
- Self-consistency decoding
- Toolformer and tool-augmented LLMs

## 7. Cloud Services and Tools
- Azure: Azure ML, AI Foundry
- AWS: SageMaker, Bedrock
- Google Cloud: Vertex AI, Generative AI Studio
- OpenRouter: Unified API for multiple LLMs
- Other Notables:
  - Hugging Face (Inference Endpoints, Transformers)
  - Replicate
  - Modal, Anyscale
  - LangChain, LlamaIndex (for orchestration and RAG)

## 8. Evaluation and Safety
- Evaluation metrics: BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity
- Red teaming and adversarial testing
- Alignment and RLHF
- Bias, fairness, and explainability

## 9. Deployment and Infrastructure
- Model hosting: on-prem, cloud, edge
- API orchestration and chaining
- Cost optimization: token usage, caching, batching

## 10. Ethics and Governance
- Responsible AI principles
- Data privacy and consent
- Model misuse and safeguards
